# Systematic conservation prioritization in R

[_Prioritizr_](https://prioritizr.github.io/prioritizr/) is an _R_ package for solving systematic conservation prioritization problems using integer linear programming (ILP) techniques. The package offers a flexible interface for creating conservation problems using a range of different objectives and constraints that can be tailored to the specific needs of the conservation planner. Conservation problems can be solved using a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers. In contrast to the algorithms conventionally used to solve conservation problems, such as greedy heuristics or simulated annealing, the exact algorithms used by _prioritizr_ are guaranteed to find optimal solutions. This package also has the functionality to read [Marxan](http://marxan.net/) input data and find much cheaper solutions in a much shorter period of time than _Marxan_ ([Beyer _et al. 2016_](http://marxan.net/downloads/papers/beyer_etal_2015.pdf)).

Speaker: Jeffrey Hanson, Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Science, The University of Queensland.

Date and Time: 11am-12pm on Tuesday 18th April in Goddard room 501, The University of Queensland.
