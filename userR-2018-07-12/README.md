Biodiversity is in crisis. To prevent further declines, protected areas need to be established in places that will achieve conservation objectives for minimal cost. However, existing decision support tools tend to offer limited customizability and can take a long time to deliver solutions. To overcome these limitations and help prioritize conservation efforts in a transparent and reproducible manner, here we present the prioritizr R package. Inspired by the tidyverse principles, this R package provides a flexible interface for articulating, building and solving conservation planning problems. In contrast to existing tools, the prioritizr R package uses integer linear programming (ILP) techniques to mathematically formulate and solve conservation problems. As a consequence, the prioritizr R package can find solutions that are guaranteed to be optimal and in record time. By finding solutions to problems that are relevant to the species, ecosystems, and economic factors in areas of interest, conservation scientists, planners, and decision makers stand a far greater chance at enhancing biodiversity.
